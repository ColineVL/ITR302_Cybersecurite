You have gained access to another attacker machine in the target network! Note that:

Termshark and tcpflow have been banned from the system after your last attack.
But this machine has tshark installed.
Interface eth0 is connected to the Firewall through which you are penetrating.
Interface eth1 is connected to a hub.
An FTP client and server are also connected to the hub.
Use the tshark command to sniff through your eth1 interface
(tshark -h to see help on how to choose your interface) and capture the flag. 
Note that you will have to reconstruct the TCP flow. 
To learn to do that check the doc (see file below) about option -z follow. 
Note that you may have to try different flow IDs before finding the right one 
and that flow reconstruction only starts when you stop the capture with CTRL-C.
