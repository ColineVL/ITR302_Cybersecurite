You have gained access to an attacker machine in the target network! Note that:

This machine has Termshark installed.
Interface eth0 is connected to the Firewall through which you are penetrating.
Interface eth1 is connected to a hub.
An FTP client and server are also connected to the hub.
Use the termshark command to sniff through your eth1 interface 
(termshark -h to see help on how to choose your interface) and capture the flag. 
Termshark supports mouse even if it is text-based. You can also hit ? to get keyboard shortcuts.
