You have gained access to another attacker machine in the target network! Note that:

Termshark has been banned from the system after your last attack.
But this machine has tcpflow installed.
Interface eth0 is connected to the Firewall through which you are penetrating.
Interface eth1 is connected to a hub.
An FTP client and server are also connected to the hub.
Use the tcpflow command to sniff through your eth1 interface
(tcpflow -h to see help on how to choose your interface) and capture the flag.
This tool reconstructs TCP flows for you making it very easy to understand 
what a, potentially long, set of TCP packets transported. 
For a quick challenge solution you can use the -c option which outputs reconstructed flows 
to the console. 
However to train yourself for more complex scenarios you may want to not use -c 
so that tcpflow writes down to local files each flow he captured (until you hit CTRL-C) 
and then browse the files to search for the flag. 
This will be useful when large flows need to be captured,
e.g. when an FTP client downloads a large file.
